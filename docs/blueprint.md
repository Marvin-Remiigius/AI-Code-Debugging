- Accent color: Analogous blue (#5C6BC0), slightly brighter and more saturated for interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headings and body text. This font offers a clean and modern aesthetic suitable for code-related content. Its uniform style lends itself well to applications focusing on code display.

- Use a clean and structured layout, with the code editor taking the central focus. A simple header and clear call-to-action (Analyze Button) should complement the interface.
